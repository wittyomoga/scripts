Production mode:
You can build your application in production mode by running command:
ng build --prod

When application is built for production mode then environments/environment.ts file gets replaced with environments/environment.prod.ts file. Hence if you are referring to settings from environment.ts file in your code, you donâ€™t have to put any if condition or hard code production URL.

For each target environment,  create a new file under folder environments. like: environment.stg.ts , environment.qa.ts

update env file with below code snipet and update according to your env settings. 
export const environment = {
  stg: true,
  environmentName: 'Stage',
  apiUrl: 'Stage url'
};

Use environment settings inside components
Your feature components/services can now use normal environment.ts file for referring settings like API URL etc.

update your compont ts accordingly. 

import { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'multiple-env-demo';
  environmentName = '';
  environmentUrl = 'Debug api';

  constructor() {
    this.environmentName = environment.environmentName;
    this.environmentUrl = environment.apiUrl;
  }
}


Update angular.json configuration. add a new section under projects/architect/build section.
"build": {
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              "fileReplacements": [
                {
                  "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
                  "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
                }
              ],
            },
            "qa": {
              "fileReplacements": [
                {
                  "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
                  "with": "src/environments/environment.qa.ts"
                }
              ]
            },
            "staging": {
              "fileReplacements": [
                {
                  "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
                  "with": "src/environments/environment.staging.ts"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }

Build application for custom environment. Now build your application for targeted environment by specific --configuration parameter to ng build command.
ng build --configuration stg
and dist folder shall contains build output with stg configuration.
