`` delete branch locally

git branch -d localBranchName

`` delete branch remotely

git push origin --delete remoteBranchName

`` The command to list all branches in local and remote repositories is:

$ git branch -a

`` If you require only listing the remote branches from Git Bash then use this command:

$ git branch -r

`` You may also use the show-branch command for seeing the branches and their commits as follows:

$ git show-branch
